I've used OMDB API as source of data for this app. 2 days after deployment, I just discovered TMDB API which provides more valuable movie details than OMDB API. Had I known TMDB API prior development, it would have been nice to use both APIs for this project.

Update: I have now migrated the app from using OMDB API to TMDB API. The effort of carefully structuring the application have made migration easier for me.
